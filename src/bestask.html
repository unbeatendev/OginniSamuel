                <h1>How It all started </h1>
                <p>Gary Kingston is looking for a remote designer to develop its new version task manager app for IOS. This app will be used by alot of people from different countries. 
                </p>

                <p class="space">Before the pandemic outbreak, I was looking for a new, exciting project to work with having 3years of experience in Ui/ Ux Design and Research.  I would love to gain more experience in designing a native mobile Application. I found  a job vacancy and sent an email to apply for it. We had an online Interview via skype and we were given a test. 
                      I made it to the team. I was so happy when the email notification came in. 

                <p class="space">I started working with the team the following week. Gary called me via skype. That was the first dicussion we had which was to discuss the remote workflow and the app's roadmap. 
              </p>

              <p class="space"><strong>Work Schedule: </strong> Full-Time Remote. Flexible Work Hours. The important thing is the end result and weekly time report.
            </p>

              <p class="space"><strong>Tools: </strong> &bullet; Adobe Xd and Adobe Suite for Design and animation &bullet; Slack for Task Management &bullet; Communication was made via Skype, Zoom and Telegram
            </p>

            <p class="space"><strong>Goals: </strong> Create Design for structured collaboration which can handle due dates, reminders, dependencies, discussions, priorities, task description, documentation, 
                task statues, assignments etc. To manage differet levels of action and offer complete workflow management. 
            </p>
            <p class="space"><strong>Workflow: </strong> I developed user flows of sections designed with description. We discussed and clarified them with the project manager, represented by Gary. I Prepared the finished layouts and sent them to the team including the iOS developer 
                Mattieu. He examines them and perfects the result under my guidance. 
            </p>
            <p class="space"><strong>Design: </strong> The interface was based on apple guidelines to be clear for any iOS user. The designs were fun to develop.

                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>No matter what industry you work in, how much you know and how much you have already achieved - you always 
                    need to work on self-improvement. But in daily routine it is so easy to lose sight of things that 
                    it is worth working on or lose motivation.  

                </p>

                <p class="space">People are very busy these days and its really very hard to keep everything in mind. We want to achieve
                    our goals and increase productivity, but sometimes it seems there's just no way to get it all done? 

                </p>

                <p class="space">Well the trick to productivity is not necessarily having more time, but instead it could 
                    simply be making the most of what we have.<em> &quot; Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet. &quot; - Henry Mintzberg</em> 

                </p>

                <p class="space"> Bestask helps you get on top of your to-do lists or managing all your tasks which are 
                    important to you. 

                </p>

                <p class="space">We are always taught to make specific, relevant and time bound goals. However the problem often lies not in 
                    setting the goal but in achieving it - in an organized conscious and effective way. This modern app was created exactly for this purpose.
