                <div class="text">
                    <p> You’re used to working in an office. You start each day grabbing a coffee. Maybe dropping the
                        kids off at school. Commuting to an office. Joining meetings. Weighing in on random
                        conversations with coworkers. Replying to emails, and going to lunch with a client. Before long,
                        you’re commuting home to gear up for the next day. The rituals of modern-day office life are
                        familiar and reliable.

                        The sudden impact of a global pandemic has forced millions of people to transition to remote
                        work without much of a warning or game plan. Most companies are scrambling to recreate office
                        life...outside the office.

                        There is a lot of mystery around remote work. The remote part, to be specific. This past week,
                        I’ve had many of my own clients ask me how i made remote work, work.  </p>

                </div>

            </div>
            <div class="content-thumb">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        So, while we’re adapting to this new norm with you, we wanted to share some of the remote life
                        strategies we’ve developed over the last decade that keep us focused, productive and connected.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Build a Strong Foundation</h1>
                    <h3>Remote-First Culture & Trust</h3>

                    <p>As Simon Sinek says, “Your company doesn’t have a culture. It is a culture.” Cultures evolve and
                        we’ve learned moving towards a remote culture means dialing up in some specific areas.

                        In a remote environment, employees make hundreds of decisions on their own every day. Here are
                        some of the things that help put these guardrails in place: </p>

                    <p class="let"> <strong> Let go of traditional productivity markers: </strong>You might have to get
                        comfortable with not actually seeing people working all the time. But it doesn't necessarily
                        mean less will get done. In fact, studies show the opposite. Often, companies see large
                        productivity gains with remote-first teams—individuals have fewer interruptions and are given
                        more freedom to work how and when works best for them. Embrace the heads-down time and think
                        about whether your questions, requests, or check-ins are as necessary as you may have initially
                        thought. Keep in mind that using the metric of output can make it easy to lose track of
                        someone’s workload, so be sure to check in once in a while to ensure they don’t feel like
                        they’re drowning.</p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Allow for varying points of view: </strong>In a remote environment, you have
                        to encourage people to speak their minds and make space for dialogue. Intentional investment in
                        creating room for conversations (big and small) is a critical part of keeping a community
                        connected remotely. The work is often better for it as this mindset encourages a variety of
                        ideas and solutions that are so important when working remotely as a team. Before a video
                        meeting, ask everyone to bring ideas or questions on the topic being discussed; heading into a
                        meeting knowing there’s going to be an opportunity to share puts people at ease knowing they’ll
                        get a turn to be heard.</p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Thank someone every day: </strong>Call out good work early and often. Take
                        time to thank somebody every day: it helps remote folks feel more visible and has the added
                        benefit of building bonds from a distance. Let your team or teammates know that you notice how
                        much they do, and recognize it. To help with this, we use a tool called Bonusly that lets you
                        collectively celebrate people’s efforts. </p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Flexible work hours: </strong>Set up core work hours when the entire team
                        can expect to be available and define these. It’s best not to make core hours an 8 hour
                        day—trust that your team is putting in the work they need to but don’t force it to be in a set 8
                        hour period. </p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Take fun seriously: </strong>In-person office culture grows around water
                        coolers, lingering after a meeting in a conference room to talk, and after-work socializing.
                        We’re here to get things done, but we’re still humans who love that social connection and it’s
                        no different remotely. We build a strong community at MetaLab outside of the work itself partly
                        through our use of ‘off-topic’ Slack channels. Building public channels about things unrelated
                        to work gives space for new jokes, blowing off steam, and finding common connections with
                        others. We've scattered some of our favourites throughout the post—like this one. </p>
                    <p class="let">Much of the above may seem like common sense. And it is. People do their best work
                        when they are supported and empowered. The more intentional everyone can be in building
                        collaboration, recognition and autonomy, the stronger and more resilient your culture will be in
                        adapting to the change and challenges that lay ahead.</p>

                    <h1>Come Together</h1>
                    <h3>Remote Communication</h3>
                    <p>Communication is so vital to working well remotely that it has its own section. While an entire
                        post could be dedicated to unearthing all the various facets of getting communication right,
                        here are some of the fundamentals of remote communication. </p>

                    <p class="let"> <strong> Communicate A lot: </strong>Work as a team to create a shared understanding
                        of what communication looks like for your company. Determine what’s better suited for
                        synchronous vs asynchronous communication. Confirm when you've received an update, and most
                        importantly, ask for clarification if something’s unclear. In a remote setting, it’s always
                        better to dial up your frequency of communication—it will benefit you and your team.</p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Document key discussions: </strong>Working remotely can mean that it’s
                        harder to document decisions with conversations happening in various forums and tools. To make
                        sure everyone is aligned, document and share all of the items you’ve discussed, decided, and
                        assigned as a team. This can be done with a follow-up Slack message or next steps post in a
                        project management tool. Minimizing gaps in decision-making and reaching decisions as a
                        collective is important to both staying efficient and giving everyone a seat at the virtual
                        table. .</p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Assume goodwill: </strong> When working remotely, text-based chat tends to
                        be the primary form of communication. But chats lack the emotional undertones that verbal cues
                        and body language convey about someone’s intent. So, we have found it is best to always start
                        with the assumption that others don't have a hidden agenda. This makes for stronger
                        relationships and stronger communication. If you ever are unsure, ask to hop on a video call and
                        chat things through. And a small thing that has become a reflex for our team: add an emoji or
                        two to a message to convey your intent with what you’re saying—even a virtual smile goes a long
                        way.</p>
                    <p class="let"> <strong>Set clear expectations: </strong> When working remotely, there are fewer
                        opportunities for those “chance encounters” to check in with quick questions and updates. Be
                        explicit about what you need in your communication at the outset of a project or meeting about
                        an upcoming milestone. Our thresholds to attune to others’ needs and priorities may be
                        diminished right now, so it doesn't hurt to dial this up to better ensure smoother sailing
                        ahead.</p>

                    <h1>You got this</h1>
                    <p>There is a lot of uncertainty about the future right now, and your team’s resilience will be
                        significantly impacted by the culture you foster, communication norms you develop, the tools you
                        use, and the space you create. For specific suggestions about remote-friendly tools, check out
